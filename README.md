## Continued improvements

-The site currently adheres to the requitement that, upon loading, the recent search history is displayed. However, I would like to get it to stick and be added to by the new searches rather than replaced by a new search. I know this has to do with the placement of "var cityHistory = []" but I'm not sure how to circumvent it.
